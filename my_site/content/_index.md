# Hello there!

My name is Angelina, and I am a data scientist passionate about developing machine learning models, statistical methods, and big-data solutions to create positive and data-driven impact.

Currently, I work to impact patient lives through early drug discovery as a data scientist at [GSK](https://us.gsk.com/en-us/home/?nis=6) part of the Encoded Technologies team. I write data pipelines, design machine learning models, and develop statistical methods to analyze the large-scale screening data that our platform generates. 

Before moving to Boston, I studied Systems Engineering (B.S.E.) and Data Science (M.S.E) at the [University of Pennsylvania](https://www.ese.upenn.edu/). I was fortunate to work with Professor Osbert Bastani on my master's thesis exploring uncertainty quantification in federated learning, as well as Professors Spyridon Bakas and Despina Kontos on [computer vision for estimating breast density from mammograms](http://arxiv.org/abs/2206.05575). As a data science intern for three summers, I used machine learning for healthcare provider marketing at [Merck](https://www.merck.com/), predicting targets from radio frequency data at [Systems Engineering Group](https://www.linkedin.com/company/systems-engineering-group/), and flagging HVAC equipment inefficiencies at [Energenz Consulting](https://www.energenz.com/). 


# Interests
- Deep learning, especially computer vision and graph neural networks
- Statistical methods and probability
- Data engineering, especially architecting big data solutions

# Fun 
Outside of work, I love running, playing Ultimate Frisbee, playing the piano, and cooking!
